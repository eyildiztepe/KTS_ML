In this project, the Epidemiology, Etiology and Symptoms of carpal tunnel disease were mentioned and the diagnosis was evaluated.  \par

Carpal tunnel syndrome severity classification estimation was made for the dataset, which was reduced to three classes and two classes, with hand samples obtained from a hospital in South Korea and obtained from 1037 patients. After establishing the models with XGBoost, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighborhood and Artificial Neural Networks classification algorithms, predictions were made for severity classification.\
